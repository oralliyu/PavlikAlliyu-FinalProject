## Cleaning Federal Data

### Making a totals table 

```{r}
# Make totals seperate table from fed_data
fed_totals <-
  raw_fed_data %>%
  filter(`Measure 2` == "Total")

```

```{r}
# Clean fed_totals
fed_totals <- 
  fed_totals %>%
  rename(Measure_2 = 'Measure 2',  Measure_1 = 'Measure 1') %>%
  spread(key = Format, value = Value) 

```

```{r}
# Remove columns
fed_totals <- 
  fed_totals %>%
  select(-'X7', -'Measure_1', -'Measure_2')

```

```{r}
# Rename remaining variables
fed_totals <- 
  fed_totals %>%
  rename(Num_Fatalities = 'Number', Rate_per_100000 = 'Rate per 100,000 Children')

```

### Cleaning original table

```{r}
# Rename and spread
fed_data <- 
  raw_fed_data %>%
  rename(Measure_2 = 'Measure 2',  Measure_1 = 'Measure 1') %>%
  spread(key = Measure_2, value = Value) %>%
  spread(key = Format, value = Total) %>%
  select(-`Rate per 100,000 Children`, -`X7`)

```

```{r}
# Remove rows (MAYBE WRITE LOOP)
fed_data <- 
  fed_data[-c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40,
              42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78,
              80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100), ]

```

```{r}
# Finish cleaning
fed_data[is.na(fed_data)] = 0

fed_data <- 
  fed_data %>%
  rename(Num_agencyfile = `Reported in the Agency File`, 
         Num_childfile = `Reported in the Child File`, 
         Total = Number) %>%
  select(-`Measure_1`)
  
  
```

```{r}
# Add rates
fed_data <-
  full_join(fed_data, fed_totals) %>%
  select(-Total)

fed_data <- 
  fed_data %>%
  mutate(State_num = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,
                       19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34,
                       35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50))
  
```




## Cleaning NCANDS Data By Breaking Down Tables

```{r}
NCANDS <-
  NCANDS %>%
  rename(Characteristic = `Characteristic Label`)

```

### Make fatality_sub_type

```{r}
fatality_sub_type <-
  NCANDS %>%
  filter(Table == "Child Fatalities by Submission Type") %>%
  select(- "Measure") %>%
  spread(key = Characteristic, value = Value) %>%
  spread(key = Format, value = Total) %>%
  select(-Rate)

fatality_sub_type <- 
  fatality_sub_type[-c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40,
              42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78,
              80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100), ]

fatality_sub_type[is.na(fatality_sub_type)] = 0

fatality_sub_type <- 
  fatality_sub_type %>%
  rename(Num_agencyfile = `Reported in the Agency File`,
         Num_childfile = `Reported in the Child File`)

```

### Make fatality_trend

```{r} 
fatality_trend <-
  NCANDS %>%
  filter(Table == "Child Fatalities, Trend") %>%
  spread(key = Measure, value = Value) %>%
  spread(key = Year, value = `Child fatalities`) %>%
  select(- Characteristic, - Format)

```

### Make victim_age

```{r}
victim_age <-
  NCANDS %>%
  filter(Table == "Child Victims by Age") %>%
  spread(key = Characteristic, value = Value)

victim_age <- 
  victim_age[-c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40,

# Remove rows that do not have a match in other tables 
victim_age <- 
  victim_age[-c(20, 28, 41), ]

victim_age[[24]] <- NULL

victim_age <- 
  victim_age %>%
  select(- Measure) %>%
  rename(Age_under1 = `Age <1`, Age_1 = `Age 1`, Age_10 = `Age 10`, Age_11 = `Age 11`, 
         Age_12 = `Age 12`, Age_13 = `Age 13`, Age_14 = `Age 14`, Age_15 = `Age 15`,

         Age_8 = `Age 8`, Age_9 = `Age 9`)


```

### Make case_type (I'm thinking to remove this table all together. It isn't that helpful)

```{r}
case_type <-
  NCANDS %>%
  filter(Table == "Children by Disposition") %>%
  spread(key = Measure, value = Value) %>%
  select(- `Nonvictims (duplicate count) by disposition`, -Format) %>%
  spread(key = Characteristic, value = `Victims (duplicate count) by disposition`) %>%
  select(- `Alternative Response`, - `Closed With No Finding`, - `Indicated`, 
         - `Intentionally False`, - `No Alleged Maltreatment`, - `Other`, - `Unknown`, 
         - `Unsubstantiated`)
case_type <- 
  case_type[-c(20, 28, 41), ]

```

### Make investigation

```{r}

  filter(Table == "Children Who Received an Investigation or Alternative Response, Trend") %>%
  spread(key = Measure, value = Value) %>%
  select(- `Children (unique count) who received an investigation or alternative response, rate per 1,000 children`) %>%
  spread(key = Year, value = `Children (unique count) who received an investigation or alternative response`) %>%
  select(- Characteristic, - Format) 

investigation <- 
  investigation[-c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40,

  spread(key = Characteristic,
         value = `Perpetrators (unique count) by relationship to their victims`) %>%
  select(- Format)

perpetrator_tally[is.na(perpetrator_tally)] = 0

perpetrator_tally <-

# Article on Child Abuse 

https://www.nspcc.org.uk/what-we-do/childrens-stories-about-abuse/ 

This website provides different childs' abuse stories. I have a collection of 5 abuse stories compiled into a word document

```{r}
Stories <- 
  read.delim('Child abuse stories.txt')


```



# This is what is left to do:

So, I am terrible at coding. Let me know if it is okay if you work on coding the stuff below that is left. I tried to do my best with what I could. I have ideas for each, I just dont know how to write the code. If you do a lot of the coding, I can take care of explaing everything, narrarating, and the guidance document. Thanks! Also, if you can't figure the rest of the stuff out, or feel like I should do more work, let me know! just shoot me a text when you are done working and I'll go through and narrate and all that jazz. 

## Data Wrangling Portion
* Use of regular expressions 
    + Trying to import article on abuse
* User-defined functions    
    + See if you can find a way to create a function to remove even rows, For example lines 94-96 and any others with this same issue
* Loops and/or control flow     
    + Use loop in function?

## Data Visualization

Can you check my graphs to make sure they meet the requirements please ?


## Data Analysis

* Statistical modeling/Supervised learning
* Unsupervised learning
* Analysis of text data
